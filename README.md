# data-analysis-task2
This project analyzes the **Global Superstore** dataset with data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning to predict sales performance using linear regression.

## Features:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: 
  - Handling missing values by filling with mean/median for numeric columns.
  - Removing duplicate records.
  - Outlier detection and removal using Interquartile Range (IQR).
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Descriptive statistics for numerical features.
  - Correlation analysis between numeric columns.
  - Visualizations, including histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and pie charts.

- **Sales Performance Analysis**:
  - Time-series analysis of sales over time.
  - Scatter plot of profit vs. discount.
  - Regional sales analysis using bar plots.
  - Category-wise sales distribution using pie charts.

- **Machine Learning**:
  - Linear Regression model to predict sales based on profit and discount.
  - Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.

## Libraries Used:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
